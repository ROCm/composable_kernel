### Acknowledgement
CK team works closely with Meta [AITemplate](link to be added) team (led by Bing Xu, Ying Zhang). Most of the lucrative graph optimization opportunities in ML models were identified by AITemplate team, and we also co-designed many high performance fused kernels for AMD GPUs. Without this collaboration, CK would not reach its current potential.
