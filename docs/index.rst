------------
Introduction
------------

This document contains instructions for installing, using, and contributing to Composable Kernel (CK).

-----------
Methodology
-----------

Composable Kernel (CK) library aims to provide a programming model for writing performance critical
kernels for machine learning workloads across multiple architectures including GPUs, CPUs, etc,
through general purpose kernel languages, like HIP C++.

CK utilizes two concepts to achieve performance portability and code maintainability:

* A tile-based programming model
* Algorithm complexity reduction for complex ML operators, using innovative technique we call
  "Tensor Coordinate Transformation".

Code Structure
--------------

Current CK library are structured into 4 layers:

* "Templated Tile Operators" layer
* "Templated Kernel and Invoker" layer
* "Instantiated Kernel and Invoker" layer
* "Client API" layer
