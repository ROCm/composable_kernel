/// This file is the main header for the CK-Builder testing system. A high-level
/// description of this testing system is documented in
/// `ck_tile/builder/testing/README.md`. This file deals mainly deals with the
/// documentation of the implementation details by forward-declaring and documenting
/// the relevant types.
///
/// The intention is that the basic testing strategy (explained in the testing
/// documentation) is available for every different type of device operation. This
/// requires us to provide some implementations in two fronts: Support for the
/// Args, Inputs, Outputs, UniqueInputs, and UniqueOutputs for all SIGNATUREs which
/// are supported by CK Builder, and support for invoking the different
/// implementations returned by CK Builder, depending on the Algorithm.
///
/// Different SIGNATUREs may require different arguments and different (amounts of)
/// input/output tensors. Rather than trying to cram all this in the same structure,
/// or to provide different types, we will use dependent typing to specialize the
/// implementation for the SIGNATURE at hand. For this reason, the Args, Inputs,
/// Outputs, UniqueInputs, and UniqueOutputs structures are all parameterized by the
/// SIGNATURE. The idea is to use C++20 concepts to limit the specialization to the
/// subset of SIGNATUREs that conceptually make sense for that implementation. For
/// example, to provide an implementation of the testing framework for forward
/// convolutions, we can use a concept to check whether the SIGNATURE is a valid
/// forward convolution signature:
///
///     template <auto SIGNATURE>
///         requires ValidConvSignature<SIGNATURE> && ConvDirectionIsForward<SIGNATURE>
///     struct Args<SIGNATURE> { ... }; // Similar for the other types
///
/// Invocation of instances is another matter: The Builder may return instances from
/// either CK or CK-Tile depending on the ALGORITHM configuration. The only place
/// where this matters is the implementation of `run()`, which needs to provide a
/// custom implementation for all instances which the Builder may return, including
/// the reference implementation. The strategy is the same here: Use concepts to
/// check whether the instance returned by the builder is of a particular type, and
/// overload the `run()` function for that concept:
///
///     template <auto SIGNATURE, typename Conv>
///         requires
///             // Check that the SIGNATURE is of the type that we expect
///             ValidConvSignature<SIGNATURE> && ConvDirectionIsForward<SIGNATURE> &&
///             // Also check that the instance is of a type which we can invoke here
///             IsCkConvInstance<SIGNATURE, Conv>
///     void run(Conv& conv, ...);
///
/// Note that this is only the suggested strategy; you may also use `if constexpr`
/// or similar to dispatch the correct implementation of the instance in the
/// implementation of the `run()` function for a particular group of device
/// operations.
///
/// The remainder of this file describes the types and functions that should be
/// overloaded for a particular device operation, and in which situation.
