/// and supports all relevant operations on that.
///
/// @note In practical terms, this type is not just an alias of `std::array` for
/// two reasons: First, writing a separate type allows us to write a custom
/// CTAD deduction guideline. This allows users to write `Extent{1, 2, 3}` and
/// get an instance of the correct type, whereas `std::array{1, 2, 3}` yields an
/// instance of `std::array<int, 3>`. This, in turn, allows inferring the rank
/// from the instance (useful in combination with `make_descriptor`), as it alows
/// us to write `function(Extent{1, 2, 3})`. Note that `function({1, 2, 3})` is
/// not valid before C++26 because `{1, 2, 3}` is an initializer list (even if
/// `function` accepts an instance of `Extent`), which does not have a known size
/// at compile time. Second, creating a separate struct for the `Extent` allows
